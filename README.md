### Create a function and test it with the correct event


After creation of a lambda fonction on the aws account, we need now to configure it and test it


1. We need to trigger first the lambda function with the proper service

![trigger](/image/trigger%20S3.png)


2. We write our code

![code](/image/Code%20lambda.png)


3. We insert the correct test event

![test event](/image/test%20event.png)

This test event will replace the trigger of S3 

---

Having deployed the lambda function, we can now test it with the correct event
